## About
This repository contains five files: one that investigates Simulone, two that investigate Mutation Simulator, and two that investigate simuG. The files may run with errors due to specific paths used throughout the project, as well as the dataset not being uploaded. This code is intended for review only.

## Datasets used for each file
